Set by step to do list will be uploaded as well as some more sources. Check the folders in source for more information on the respective parts. But in general:
1. Get the Qualisys data stream running. Get the cameras running on the old Qualisys computer. Configure them for now so that the send out a TTL signal when they take a frame and record at 100 Hz. We have to talk on the marker placement and how to generate a AIM model.
2. Get the camera stream running. Configure cameras to the right settings and synchronize them with Qualisys via TTL and LSL.
3. Synchronize everything with the EEG via the TriggerBox using TTL and LSL
4. Update the exergame
(5. Synchronize VR glasses with EEG using the photosensor)
