1	09:05:52	Not all gaps were filled	52 gaps out of 77 were filled. The other 25 gaps were longer than 10 frames (max gap length).  Adjust maximum gap length in trajectories settings in project options or in reprocessing trajectories settings.

1	09:06:33	1 model failed to apply	1 model failed to apply.  Note: Partial success, or failure to identify, usually indicates that the model needs more training.  Correct the identification by hand and then add the fully identified file to the AIM model. Use "Add to existing model(s)" to improve AIM performance.

1	09:30:39	Rigid bodies did not always match definition	When 6D data is calculated from the positions of markers, at least three of the points of a body must be present in a data frame to let QTM calculate the 6D position of the rigid body.  Even if three or more points are present in a frame, sometimes the 6D position is not calculated anyway, because the distances between points do not match the rigid body definition well enough.  This happened now: Body "LUPA": in 3268 of the 4152 frames where at least three points were present  To avoid this, either increase the "Bone length tolerance" parameter, improve the rigidity of the body or correct the definition of the body.
