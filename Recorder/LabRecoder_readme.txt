This is the LabStreamingLayer LabRecoder. It's probably an outdated version. What it does is it scans the network for LSL streams and records them. Outputing a .xdf file. A config file (XML) has to be generated for this project to automate some of the startup procedures and avoid human error, like which streams must be online, where to save the file, remote control, etc. The documentation is lacking, but it is not super important. Just convenient.
